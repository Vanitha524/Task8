# Task8
This exercise focuses on creating Stored Procedures and Functions in MySQL.
The goal is to modularize SQL logic and make queries reusable.
Using the employee table, we created:

A stored procedure GetEmployeesByDept to fetch employees by department.

A function CalculateBonus to compute a 10% annual bonus.
This demonstrates how to simplify complex operations and maintain cleaner SQL code.
